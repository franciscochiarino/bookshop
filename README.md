# [Bookshop](https://bookstore-fran.herokuapp.com/#/)

A simple online bookshop created with the MERN stack and Redux.

## General Info

This project is not intended for production. 
The reason I built it was to practice building web applications from scratch and get familiarized with the use of Redux.

## Features

- Users can create an account and add/remove books to a cart.
- Admins can add books to the database through a simple form.
- Uploading images to the database is possible and simple thanks to GridFS.
- Passwords are encrypted before being saved to the database with bcrypt.
- Forms are validated with express-validator.

To Do:
- Create a wish list so the user can add book lists without adding them to the cart.
- Create an address schema so that the admin receives a detailed report once the orders are placed.
- Give the admin the possibility to edit uploaded books, amounts, users, etc.
