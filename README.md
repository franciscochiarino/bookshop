# Bookshop

A simple online bookshop created with the MERN stack and Redux.

## General Info

This project is not intended for production. 
The reason I built it was to practice building web applications from scratch and get familiarized with the use of Redux.

## Technologies

- React 16
- Sass
- Redux 4
- Express 4
- GridFS
- JWT 
- MongoDB
- Node.js 12

## Features

- Users can create an account and add/remove books to a cart.
- Admins can add books to the database through a simple form.
- Uploading images to the database is possible and simple.

To Do:
- Create a wish list so the user can add book lists without adding them to the cart.
- Create an address schema so that the admin receives a detailed report once the orders are placed.
- Give the admin the possibility to edit uploaded books, amounts, users, etc.
